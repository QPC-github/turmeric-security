# This file consists the input data for GetGroupMembersTests

# There are two formats one for subjectgroup creation and other for request/response creation and validation

# Format for SubjectGroup creation
#  subjectGroupDetails_policy# = SubjectGroupName:SubjectGroupType:SubjectGroupDescription: \n
# (if calculated subjectgroup then set 1 / if non-calculated subjectgroup then set 0):  \n
# (if calculated then set the name that is associated with the name in CalculatedSubjectGroupConfig.xml file / if non-calculated then the SG is associated with list of subjects(subjectname#subjecttype) separated by &)

# Format for Request/Response creation and validation
# request_policy_test# = This is for our reference that the request object created is based off defined policies
# request_sglist_test# = SubjectGroupName: SubjectGroup ID
# output_memberlist_test# = #number (validate the size of the SG)
# output_totalSG_test# = #number (validate total SG count for which the subjects can be retrieved, for non-calculated SG the count will be >0 but for Calculated SG the count doesn't exists)
# output_sgDetails_test# = Comma seperated list of SG details, format is SubjectGroup Name:number of subjects assigned to this SG: subject name delimited by &
